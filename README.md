# Evolutionary dynamics of chromosomal inversions in Danaus chrysippus

This repository record the scripts and commands used for my summer project in Simon Martin's lab on the evolutionary dynamics of chromosomal inversions in the African monarch.

The project was subdivided in different steps:

- Inversion detection in long-read assemblies
- Determination of inversions gene density (+ detection of potential genes at breakpoints)
- Inversion genotyping in short-read assemblies
- Computation of popgen stats (Fst, dxy and Tajima's D) for each inversions
